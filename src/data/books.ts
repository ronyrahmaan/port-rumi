    title: 'Handbook of Public Policy in Asia',
    subtitle: 'Chapter: Public policy in Bangladesh: confronting top-down, incremental, and political interference',
    description: 'Policies are essential for organizing and guiding actions in many areas of a country. They are often defined as rules that guide decisions, actions, or a course of action. They can come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and may be institutional, private, governmental, group-based, or even individual. Although the term \'public policy\' covers a wide range of ideas, it often refers to the guiding principles of a government and/or actions taken with the specific intent of resolving public concerns and advancing the public interest. However, the results of any public policy are greatly influenced by the way it is formulated and carried out. Many countries, including Bangladesh, develop various national or public policies that outline what must be done and accomplished in a range of public realms in the best interests of the people. This chapter explores the public policy landscape in Bangladesh. It starts with the historical trajectories of public policy in the country. It then elaborates on key methods of policy analysis by highlighting their top-down, incremental, and political natures. After that, the chapter identifies key actors in policy formulation in Bangladesh before clarifying the implementation and evaluation stages of public policy. Next, it explains policy education, training, research, and practice in the country, followed by a case study on environmental policy. It ends by analyzing the general features of Bangladesh\'s public policy, including political interference.',

    title: 'Contemporary Issues and Problems of Public Administration in Bangladesh',
    subtitle: 'Chapter: The Role of the Village Court as an Alternative Dispute Resolution Tool in Rural Bangladesh: Promises and Practices',
    description: 'The Village Court (VC) in Bangladesh serves as an Alternative Dispute Resolution institution that collaborates closely with the local government system to administer justice at the local level in a cost-effective and timely manner. It not only alleviates the burden on the judiciary but also enhances social cohesion within the community. Despite the numerous advantages of this new system, there are serious allegations concerning the quality of judgement, the competence of the VC board members, the investigation procedure, and the implementation of the decisions made in the courtroom. Still, it is widely believed that this system significantly impacts the ability of marginalised individuals from rural locales in getting justice, and diminishing the influence of rural elites in the legal system. Enhancing public knowledge regarding VC regulations, ensuring strict implementation of courtroom decisions, and providing comprehensive training to local administrators on the VC system are crucial for optimising the impact of this groundbreaking local government innovation in Bangladesh.',

        title: 'Forced Migration and Transnational Crime in Southeast Asia',
        description: 'Migration research and literature exist on a polarized continuum between "force" and "will" of individuals or collective groups who choose to relocate across geographical space for ecological, social, economic, or political reasons. Both voluntary and involuntary migration require migrants to adapt to a new place, norms, and livelihood, but forced migration presents distinctive difficulties, vulnerabilities, and traditional and nontraditional threats, such as terrorism, arms smuggling, and human and drug trafficking, that threaten individuals, societies, and states. Scholars and analysts suggest that migration and security are intertwined, yet, whether migration causes security threats or security causes migration, there is no clear answer, hence requiring a comprehensive analysis and correlation. At current times, Southeast Asia is a source, transit route, and destination for the growing number of displaced individuals from violence and persecution, and these 11 nations (Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) account for a large share of the world\'s displaced people, compared to advanced north nations. In this chapter, an extensive document analysis of secondary materials has been conducted to link transnational crimes and forced migrations to security issues. This chapter uses four models—importation, strain, cultural conflict, and bias—to suggest a tentative causal link between transnational crimes and forced migration in Southeast Asia. According to the chapter\'s findings, protecting people\'s rights in Southeast Asia from the security risks posed by forced migration—driven by political, economic, and environmental factors—is becoming more urgent.'

        title: 'From Diaspora to Diplomacy: Migration and Regional Power in South Asia',
        description: 'Migration is an essential issue in South Asia because of its complex patterns of internal, regional, and global mobility that are influenced by social, political, economic, and environmental factors. Despite their shared history, culture, and economy, South Asian countries face a number of challenges when it comes to managing migration. Regional organizations like SAARC, BIMSTEC, SASEC, and others have been critical in addressing migratory issues, despite the fact that their effectiveness has been shaped by national interests, regional power dynamics, and the unequal relationships among the South Asian states. The chapter argues that, despite the fact that migration is a critical issue in South Asia, regional political barriers such as member-state bilateral disputes, institutional and financial constraints, and SAARC\'s inaction have reduced the effectiveness of regional cooperation and complicated cross-border policy implementation.'

        title: 'Impacts of Covid 19 on Textile Industry Workers in Bangladesh: Socio-Economic Perspective',
        description: 'This study is designed to explore the impacts of the COVID pandemic on the socio-economic status of textile workers and to suggest ways for balancing the turnover rate. For the study, a cross-sectional study design and mixed-method approach were employed. The researchers conducted a questionnaire survey of 357 textile workers using convenience sampling and, 5 KIIs, 20 IDIs, and 5 FGDs using purposive sampling. The study area was the Gazipur district of Bangladesh, a hub of the textile industry. Findings from Principle component analysis revealed that 54.38% of the total observed variation can be explained by five components. Working Environment (r = –0.699), Payment System (r = .987), Savings (r = .920), Employee Turnover Rate (r = .769), and Social Status (r = .558) of employees are identified by PCA as the most strongly correlated variables that have significant impacts on the socio-economic condition of textile workers due to Covid 19 pandemic. Finally, through Logistic Regression Analysis, the study has found that Safe Working Environment (OR = 0.203, 95% CI 0.098-0.419), Satisfactory Payment Structure (OR = 2.196, 95% CI 1.354-3.561), and Provident Fund Facilities (OR = 2.908, 95% CI 1.497-5.651) can reduce the turnover rate of textile workers. Additionally, effective labor unions and adequate training facilities can also balance the adverse socio-economic impacts on the textile workers.'

        title: 'Cash-Aid Support of Bangladesh Government During Covid 19 Pandemic; Effectiveness and Challenges',
        description: 'The outbreak of COVID 19 has affected a number of countries throughout the world. The widespread disruptions of COVID 19 on the world economy and people\'s livelihood are devastating, and, the lower-middle and lower-income people endure the worst hit of the pandemic. Bangladesh also, has undergone tremendous economic recession, unemployment, and poverty, and the marginal poor people in Bangladesh has become the worst bearer of COVID 19 Pandemic implications. The nationwide restrictions to contain the infection have made the situation unbearable for these poor people. To mitigate these sufferings and social inequality, the government intervened for ensuring the basic needs of the lower-income people. This intervention was carried out through a massive stimulus scheme. Among them, the PM\'s Cash-Aid is one intervention that was initiated to protect the mass people who were affected and lose informal jobs due to lockdown during COVID 19. In previous, several other Cash Assistance programs have been provisioned in Bangladesh for the vulnerable groups, however, controversies arose regarding the effectiveness of those programs. Becoming conscious of this issue, the government has digitalized the service process of PM\'s Cash-Aid Program by adopting Digital Financial Service (DFS) system to support the grassroots people directly. Hence, the performance of the cash aid program to reach the targeted people was quite well, though controversies were also grown on the program effectiveness. This article based on a qualitative approach would look to assess the effectiveness and challenges of the Cash-Aid Program. After such assessment, we would like to draw the thrusting through the depiction of the dynamic process of how standard performance can be ensured in Cash Assistance Programs.'
